<h2>
Intro to Robotics
</h2>

<p text-align:center;> My ideas on robotics have changed by making me think more about how they work rather than what they do. 
<br>
What makes me excited is how advanced the technology will become in the future and how easier it will be.
<br>
I am a bit nervous about how it will be used, either good or bad.
<br>
What worked well was figuring out the basics of how circuits work by using a breadboard. 
<br>
I want to work on using actual circuits instead of online.

 <h2>
 Intro to Robotics-Blinking LEDs
 </h2> 
 
 <p>
 We worked down figure out in what order the lights had to be wired to, we could improve by making it more complicated.
 <br>
 An Arduino sketch needs to set up and then has a loop.
</p>

<h2> 
Intro to Robotics-Dance Party
</h2>

<p>
I learned that I could code something into Arduino to make the robot do actions.
<br>
My favorite part was seeing my robots dance mash up to the music I choose.
</p>

<h2>
Web Framework
</h2>

<p>
An MVC paradigm is a design pattern used to create models, it's a format that makes it easier to make a webpage
<br>
A framework is made up of libraries, so a library is much smaller.
<br>
You would use a framework rather than create a app yuour self because it is much more simple, it already has a frame for you.

   <h2>
      Algorithms
      </2>
   
   <p>
      I'm proud of figuring out how to do the project on the countries list, it would check if a country was in it or not.
      <br>
      I think that the Ray Tracing Algorithms interested me the most because I like watching how 3D animations work.
      <br>
      These algorithms can be used for an array of things, not only do they focus on a particular thing. They help 
      <br>
      everyone around us to complete simple tasks and keep the internet in order.
