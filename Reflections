<h2>
Intro to Robotics
</h2>

<p text-align:center;> My ideas on robotics have changed by making me think more about how they work rather than what they do. 
<br>
What makes me excited is how advanced the technology will become in the future and how easier it will be.
<br>
I am a bit nervous about how it will be used, either good or bad.
<br>
What worked well was figuring out the basics of how circuits work by using a breadboard. 
<br>
I want to work on using actual circuits instead of online.

 <h2>
 Intro to Robotics-Blinking LEDs
 </h2> 
 
 <p>
 We worked down figure out in what order the lights had to be wired to, we could improve by making it more complicated.
 <br>
 An Arduino sketch needs to set up and then has a loop.

<h2> 
Intro to Robotics-Dance Party
</h2>

<p>
I learned that I could code something into Arduino to make the robot do actions.
<br>
My favorite part was seeing my robots dance mash up to the music I choose.
